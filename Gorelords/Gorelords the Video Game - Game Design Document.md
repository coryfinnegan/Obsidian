## 1. Game Overview

**Title:** Gorelords the Video Game

**Genre:** Party Brawler

**Platform(s):** PC, Console (Switch and XBox), Crossplay enabled with matchmaking 

**Target Audience:** Casual players who want a fun gaming experience with friends.

**High Concept:** Gorelords the Video Game is a gory and frantic party brawler.  2-4 players will select from a roster of toys from the Gorelords toy series.  They will fight in a 2d plane with platforms and multiple levels. Gameplay will be frantic quick matches where the toys will use unique abilities to fight each other.  Abilities will be melee and ranged.  Think ultra violent Smash Bros with toys and weapons. 

**Unique Selling Points:** The playable character sprites will be digitized photographs, or an equivalent, to achieve the look of the Gorelords toys (think Mortal Kombat with plastic toys) Backgrounds will be hand painted in the box art style of the Gorelords toys.  It will have harken to an era of 90s gaming that is fun and spilling over with over the top toy violence.

## 2. Core Gameplay

**Core Loop:** 2-4 players will pick their character and then fight in an arena.  

**Primary Mechanics:** Players fight each other with a mix of melee and ranged weapons depending on the character they have chosen.  There are knock backs, defensive moves, jumping with varying degrees of mobility, and special attacks.   Characters will fit archetypes like glass cannon, heavy, ranger etc. 

**Player Goals:**  Fight other Gorelords

**Win/Loss Conditions:** They will have a 3 lives.  If they are brought down to 0 health or knocked off the map they will lose a life.  When you are out of lives you are knocked out of the match.  The last player standing wins.

## 4. Game Mechanics

### 4.1 Player Mechanics

- Movement
	- Players can move: 
		- All characters can move horizontally in a 2d plane by walking forward and backward.  
		- Players can jump, but their jump height depends on their character. Where
- Actions/Abilities
	- Maggotgagger
		- Melee attack is with slime fists that cover the character in a slime that does a small damage over time (the stink hurts you)
		- Ranged is a CC that slows by throwing slime covered maggots
- The Suffer
	- Melee is a mace that can stun with diminishing returns
	- No ranged attack, but is immune or resistant to knockbacks
	- When low on health he does more damage
- Time-Gore
	- Time gore can time warp.  Players must use it strategically by setting a start time and then invoking their time warp.  When he time warps he goes back to the same health that he was at. 
	- Does Melee damage 
	- Does a time -charge (think like a dash) where he shifts ahead and does damage. 
- Doc Marauder
	- Weak melee damage
	- Shoots crossbows with differing abilities? WIP not sure about this dude but he looks kinda quick like he could be jumping around shooting you with his cross bow like a dingus. 
- Gumongous
	- Melee grabber type.  Hits with swords and grabs and bites.  Kinda slow but if he gets you it hurts. 
- Arthur
	- Has shotgun hand and noose hand.  He is a butcher style character where he grabs and pulls you close and then shoots you. 
	- Agile and can also disappear for a brief few seconds but he loses health while invisible. 
- Murdroid
	- Chain saw melee
	- Lasers from his head
	- Has rocket boosters and can drop down on you with his spikey back but he gets stuck for a second
- Quantum Wolf
	- He runs on all fours and leaps on his victims biting the fuck out of them and then drilling with his robot hand. Can jump high. 
- Ichor
	- Beserker type hits you with his axe and spikey stick
	- Can run fast on his hooven legs and leap well. 
- Psycops
	- Beats you with his nightstick
	-  Shoots you with his gun
	- Fucking sucks, intentionally the worst character in the game because fuck cops.
- Trollborg
	- Super heavy
	- High armor 
	- Melee only
	- Stupid but effective 
	- Simple for people who are simple
- Snotpile
	- Is a snot pile. 
	- Can jump around and bite you
	- Only bites but is fast and hard to hit and if he hits you you take damage. 
- Interaction systems
	- They fight each other
- Progression systems
	- None

### 4.2 Game Systems

- Combat 
	- Party brawler style combat mixed with hero shooter style abilities.  Each character has 2-3 attacks.  
- AI behavior
	- First MVP will not have AI but we will eventually have the option for 1 player with bots
- Physics
	- Exaggerated physics, lots of bonking with knock backs and stuff.

### 4.3 Progression
- Unlockables
	- Unlock different variants of the toys.
- Difficulty curve
	- Certain characters are harder to play than others. Guiding light is easy to learn - very hard to master.

## 5. Levels and Environments

**Level Design Philosophy:** The levels will be hand crafted painted scenes.  They will feel like the card stock of a toy. 

**World Structure:** Just arenas, but menus will also be the back of toy boxes that you navigate.  

**Key Locations:** TBD

**Environmental Challenges:** Arenas will have platforms and pits you can die in.  We may also have some environmental dangers to make things more chaotic. 

---

## 6. Art and Audio

**Visual Style:** Characters will look like soft vinyl toys.  Backgrounds will look hand painted.  Menus will look like the back of a cardstock of the gorelords toy. 

**Character Design:** The characters will look like the soft vinyl Gorelords toys.  We have to 3d scan them or use photography as a starting point, but the idea is that we want a retro mortal kombat feel in the gameplay.

**UI/UX Design:** Things should feel real and handmade

**Audio Design:** Synthwave music, over the top sound effects, when players hit each it sounds like plastic crunching 

---

## 7. Technical Requirements

**Engine:** Godot

**Minimum Specs:** Potato

**Key Technical Features:** Getting the characters to look like plastic will be hard. 

**Performance Targets:** 
- This is a low end game
---

## 8. Monetization (if applicable)

**Business Model:** Pay once model. No DRM.

**In-game Purchases:** Nothing, everything is unlockable in the game.

**Ethical Considerations:** The spirit of the 90s is alive.
