**Title:** Gorelords the Video Game

**Genre:** Party Brawler

**Platform(s):** PC, Console (Switch and XBox), Crossplay enabled with matchmaking 

**Target Audience:** Casual players who want a fun gaming experience with friends.

**High Concept:** Gorelords the Video Game is a gory and frantic party brawler.  2-4 players will select from a roster of toys from the Gorelords toy series.  They will fight in a 2d plane with platforms and multiple levels. Gameplay will be frantic quick matches where the toys will use unique abilities to fight each other.  Abilities will be melee and ranged.  Think ultra violent Smash Bros with toys and weapons. 

**Unique Selling Points:** The playable character sprites will be digitized photographs, or an equivalent, to achieve the look of the Gorelords toys (think Mortal Kombat with plastic toys) Backgrounds will be hand painted in the box art style of the Gorelords toys.  It will have harken to an era of 90s gaming that is fun and spilling over with over the top toy violence.

## 4. Game Mechanics

### 4.1 Player Mechanics

- Movement
	- Players can move: 
		- All characters can move horizontally in a 2d plane by walking forward and backward.  
		- Players can jump, but their jump height depends on their character. Where
- Actions/Abilities
	- Maggotgagger
		- Melee attack is with slime fists that cover the character in a slime that does a small damage over time (the stink hurts you)
		- Ranged is a CC that slows by throwing slime covered maggots
- The Suffer
	- Melee is a mace that can stun with diminishing returns
	- No ranged attack, but is immune or resistant to knockbacks
	- When low on health he does more damage
- Time-Gore
	- Time gore can time warp.  Players must use it strategically by setting a start time and then invoking their time warp.  When he time warps he goes back to the same health that he was at. 
	- Does Melee damage 
	- Does a time -charge (think like a dash) where he shifts ahead and does damage. 
- Doc Marauder
	- Weak melee damage
	- Shoots crossbows with differing abilities? WIP not sure about this dude but he looks kinda quick like he could be jumping around shooting you with his cross bow like a dingus. 
- Gumongous
	- Melee grabber type.  Hits with swords and grabs and bites.  Kinda slow but if he gets you it hurts. 
- Arthur

	- Agile and can also disappear for a brief few seconds but he loses health while invisible.

	- Chain saw melee
	- Lasers from his head
	- Has rocket boosters and can drop down on you with his spikey back but he gets stuck for a second

	- Beserker type hits you with his axe and spikey stick
	- Can run fast on his hooven legs and leap well. 
- Psycops
	- Beats you with his nightstick
	-  Shoots you with his gun

	- Stupid but effective 
	- Simple for people who are simple
- Snotpile

### 4.2 Game Systems

- Combat 
	- Party brawler style combat mixed with hero shooter style abilities.  Each character has 2-3 attacks.  
- AI behavior
	- First MVP will not have AI but we will eventually have the option for 1 player with bots
- Physics
	- Exaggerated physics, lots of bonking with knock backs and stuff.

### 4.3 Progression
- Unlockables
	- Unlock different variants of the toys.
- Difficulty curve
	- Certain characters are harder to play than others. Guiding light is easy to learn - very hard to master.
